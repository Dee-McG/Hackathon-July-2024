# SUBMISSION

## Deployment

The project is deployed and can be accessed [here](https://dee-mcg.github.io/Hackathon-July-2024/).

## Intro

The focus of our project was education, the main barrier to discrimination and bias is ignorance. By making easily accessible education to terms and flags of the LGBTQIA+ community we hope to break down some of thos barriers. If any users enjoy our site we have quick links to key LGBT focused charities that users can donate to if they wish.

## Goal

### Problem
Even with the huge amount of progress with LGBT issues being brought forward that has presented challenges to those not part of the community with common terms and the history of the movement. 

### Objective
To have easily accessible and fun games that should help break down any barriers to being familiar with LGBT individuals

### Target audience
Those not already in the LGBT community

### Benefits
less ignorance and potential donations to key causes!

## Tech

Our project was made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The bootstrap framework was used for speed of development
