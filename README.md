# SUBMISSION

## Deployment

The project is deployed and can be accessed [here](https://dee-mcg.github.io/Hackathon-July-2024/).

## Intro

The focus of our project was education, the main barrier to discrimination and bias is ignorance. By making easily accessible education to terms and flags of the LGBTQIA+ community we hope to break down some of thos barriers. If any users enjoy our site we have quick links to key LGBT focused charities that users can donate to if they wish.

## Goals

### Problem
Even with the huge amount of progress with LGBT issues being brought forward that has presented challenges to those not part of the community with common terms and the history of the movement. 

### Objective
To build a fun and educational site to help people learn about Pride & LGBTQIA+ history through mini-games and interactive content.

### Target audience
Those not already in the LGBT community

### Benefits
Less ignorance and potential donations to key causes!

## Design

The main site design prototype was made with UIzard, only the home page and quiz page were planned for MVP and designed.

The header and adhoc pages were built using the same theme but without prototypes.

Some changes to the card backgrounds were done.
